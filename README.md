 
Efflorescence is a metaverse game Project!!! Founding Leader : Alperen ANIL

The Efflorescence Token is a cryptocurrency produced on this game using the TRON(TRC10) network.

Efflorescence game offers its users the opportunity to make a profit in the game!!!

e.g; You bought a property in the game and you can earn EFF TOKEN by selling this property to another player

Efflorescence plans to take a different position in the game industry by aiming to provide high incomes to its game users.


We are planning to put this game project into operation in 2022, in case of possible disruptions, we will launch our game in the 2nd quarter of 2023 at the latest.

There will be more than one city in the game. Each city will have a limited number of properties!!! You can transfer your properties from City to City...

The transfer process will take place with the ships and planes in the game... You can make your transfers by paying the fees determined by the ship and aircraft owners.. 


10,000 = Characters 20,000 = Car 10,000 = house 5,000= Office 50 = Airplane 50 = Ship 1 = Efflorescence Store Maximum number of properties in 1 city will be as stated above!!! There was no limit on transfers from city to city!!!
